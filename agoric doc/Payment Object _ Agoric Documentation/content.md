Payment Object [​](#payment-object)
===================================

A **Payment** holds digital assets that are in transit or expected to soon be in transit. It can be deposited in **[Purses](./purse.html)**, split into or combined with multiple **Payments**, or claimed (i.e., getting an exclusive **Payment** and revoking access from anyone else).

Digital assets in **Payments** can be any of:

* Currency-like, such as our imaginary *Quatloos* currency.
* Goods-like digital assets, such as theater tickets or magic weapons used in a game.
* Other kinds of rights, such as the right to participate in a particular contract.

A **Payment** is linear, meaning either a **Payment** has its full original balance, or it is used up entirely. You cannot partially use a **Payment**. In other words, if a **Payment** is 10 *Quatloos*, you can't take out, say, only 3 *Quatloos* from it.

However, you can split a **Payment** into multiple **Payments**. For example, you could split a 10 *Quatloos* **Payment** into two new **Payments** of 3 *Quatloos* and 7 *Quatloos* by calling the **[anIssuer.split()](./issuer.html#anissuer-split-payment-paymentamounta)** method which consumes the original 10 *Quatloos* **Payment** and creates two new smaller **Payments**.

**Payments** are often received from other actors. Since they are not self-verifying, you cannot trust **Payments**. To get the verified balance of a **Payment**, call the **[anIssuer.getAmountOf()](./issuer.html#anissuer-getamountof-payment)** method.

To convert a **Payment** into a new **Purse**:

1. Get the **Payment**'s trusted **[Issuer](./issuer.html)**.
2. Use the **Issuer** to create an empty **Purse**.
3. Deposit the **Payment** into the new **Purse**.

**[aPurse.deposit()](./purse.html#apurse-deposit-payment-optamount)** consumes the **Payment**, making it unavailable for later use.

aPayment.getAllegedBrand() [​](#apayment-getallegedbrand)
---------------------------------------------------------

* Returns: **[Brand](./brand.html)**

Returns the **Brand** indicating the kind of digital asset this **Payment** purports to be. Because **Payments** are not trusted, any method calls on them should be treated with suspicion and verified elsewhere. Any successful operation by an **Issuer** on a **Payment** verifies it.

js
```
const payment = quatloosMint.mintPayment(AmountMath.make(quatloosBrand, 10n));
// Should return 'quatloos'
const allegedBrand = payment.getAllegedBrand();
```

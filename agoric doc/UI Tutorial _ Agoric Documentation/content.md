UI Tutorial [​](#ui-tutorial)
=============================

In this tutorial you will build your own UI from scratch. Along the way, you'll learn how to connect to a wallet, query the blockchain and smart contract state, sign transactions, and more! To follow along, check your work, and help if you get stuck, you can use the <https://github.com/agoric-labs/ui-tutorial> repo as a reference. Each section of the tutorial has an associated branch in the repo to act as a checkpoint.

Prerequisites [​](#prerequisites)
---------------------------------

See [Getting Started](./../../getting-started/) first to get your environment, including a local chain, up and running. This tutorial will walk through, from start to finish, how to build a UI for the "Offer Up" dapp as seen in that example.

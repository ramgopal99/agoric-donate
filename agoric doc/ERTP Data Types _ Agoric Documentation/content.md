ERTP Data Types [​](#ertp-data-types)
=====================================

ERTP introduces and uses several data types.

Amount [​](#amount)
-------------------

An **Amount** is a description of digital assets, answering the questions "how much?" (its **[AmountValue](#amountvalue)**) and "of what kind?" (its **[Brand](./brand.html)**). The **[AmountMath](./amount-math.html)** object introduces a library of methods that can be used to manipulate and analyze **Amounts**.

Note that **Amounts** can describe either fungible or non-fungible assets.

js
```
someAmount: {
  brand: someBrand,
  value: someValue
}
```

AmountShape [​](#amountshape)
-----------------------------

An **AmountShape** is a description of non-fungible digital assets. Similar to **[Amount](#amount)**, **AmountShape** has 2 properties: a **[Brand](./brand.html)**, which states what kind of asset this is, and a **ValueShape**, which is an object containing however many properties are required to describe this non-fungible asset. Note that an asset's **ValueShape** is defined by the *elementShape* parameter when the asset's **[Issuer](./issuer.html)** is created via the **[makeIssuerKit()](./issuer.html#makeissuerkit-allegedname-assetkind-displayinfo-optshutdownwithfailure-elementshape)** function.

js
```
someAmountShape: {
  brand: someBrand,
  valueShape: someValueShape
}
```

AmountValue [​](#amountvalue)
-----------------------------

An **AmountValue** is the part of an [Amount](#amount) that describes the value of something that can be owned or shared: how much, how many, or a description of a unique asset, such as $3, Pixel(3,2), or “Seat J12 for the show September 27th at 9:00pm”. For a fungible **Amount**, the **AmountValue** is usually a non-negative **BigInt** such as `10n` or `137n`. For a non-fungible **Amount**, the **AmountValue** might be a [CopySet](/guides/js-programming/far.html#pass-styles-and-harden) containing strings naming particular rights or objects representing the rights directly. AmountValues must be [Keys](/glossary/#key).

AssetKind [​](#assetkind)
-------------------------

There are several kinds of Assets.

* **AssetKind.NAT** : Used with fungible assets. **AmountValues** are natural numbers using the JavaScript [BigInt](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/BigInt) type to avoid overflow risks from using the usual JavaScript **Number** type.
* **AssetKind.SET** : Deprecated.
* **AssetKind.COPY\_SET** : Used with non-fungible assets where there can't be duplicates (e.g., assigned seats in a stadium). See [@endo/patterns CopySet](https://endojs.github.io/endo/types/_endo_patterns.CopySet.html).
* **AssetKind.COPY\_BAG** : Used with semi-fungible assets where there can be duplicates. The duplicates of the same asset are fungible with each other (e.g., weapons in a computer game). See [@endo/patterns CopyBag](https://endojs.github.io/endo/types/_endo_patterns.CopyBag.html).

Even though very different mathematical processes are performed, **[AmountMath](./amount-math.html)** methods work for all kinds of assets.

Use **[makeIssuerKit()](./issuer.html#makeissuerkit-allegedname-assetkind-displayinfo-optshutdownwithfailure-elementshape)** to specify which **AssetKind** your contract uses. See the **[Issuer](./issuer.html)** documentation for details on how to use this method.

js
```
import { AssetKind, makeIssuerKit } from '@agoric/ertp';
makeIssuerKit('quatloos'); // Defaults to AssetKind.NAT and undefined DisplayInfo
makeIssuerKit('kitties', AssetKind.COPY_SET); // Defaults to undefined DisplayInfo
```

DisplayInfo [​](#displayinfo)
-----------------------------

A **DisplayInfo** data type is associated with a **[Brand](./brand.html)** and gives information about how to display that **Brand**'s **[Amounts](#amount)**. **DisplayInfo** has one optional property, **decimalPlaces**, which takes a non-negative integer value.

The **decimalPlaces** property tells the [display software](https://github.com/Agoric/ui-kit) how many places to move the decimal point over to the left so as to display the value in the commonly used denomination (e.g., display "10.00 dollars" rather than "1000 cents").

Fungible digital assets are represented in integers, in their smallest unit. For example, the smallest unit for a US dollar might be either *dollar* or *cent*. If it's *dollar*, **decimalPlaces** would be **0**. If it's *cent*, **decimalPlaces** would be **2**. Similarly, if you want the smallest unit of ether (the cryptocurrency coin used on the Ethereum network) to be *wei* (one ether = 1018 wei), then **decimalPlaces** would be **18**.

Non-fungible assets have values that are arrays, so you shouldn't specify a **decimalPlaces** value for them.

**decimalPlaces** should be used for display purposes only. Any other use is an anti-pattern.

**DisplayInfo** also has an **[AssetKind](#assetkind)** property. Its value specifies the kind of the associated asset.

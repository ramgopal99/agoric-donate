Installation and Deployment [â€‹](#installation-and-deployment)
=============================================================

The dApp implements a smart contract that can be installed and deployed on any Agoric testnet. Since, the contract interacts with the remote chains, we need a multichain environment for testing it on local network. [Agoric Multichain-Testing](https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk/tree/master/multichain-testing) provides such an environment to test Orchestration based contracts. Follow the instructions in [dApp Readme](https://github.com/Agoric/dapp-orchestration-basics/blob/main/README.md) to install, deploy and interact with the dApp on your local machine.

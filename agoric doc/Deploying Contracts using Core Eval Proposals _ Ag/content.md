Deploying Contracts using Core Eval Proposals [​](#deploying-contracts-using-core-eval-proposals)
=================================================================================================

To deploy a contract:

1. Check access and governance norms for your target network / chain.
   * `agoriclocal` is operated by you and entirely under your control.
   * [testnets such as `devnet`](#deploying-to-testnets-devnet-emerynet) are shared resources.
   * *Mainnet deployment is out of scope of this document; see [Mainnet 2 Deployment Checklist #8280](https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk/discussions/8280).*
2. Build the transaction contents.
3. Sign and broadcast the transactions using a web UI or CLI tools.

Deploying to a local agoric blockchain [​](#deploying-to-a-local-agoric-blockchain)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Ensure that you have [started your local agoric blockchain](./../getting-started/#starting-a-local-agoric-blockchain): use `yarn docker:logs` to check that your chain is running; if not, use `yarn start:docker` to start it.
2. Use `yarn start` to automatically
   
   1. Build the transaction contents (contract bundle, core eval script).
   2. Ensure you have enough IST to pay to for the `install-bundle` transaction.
   3. Sign and broadcast the transactions (`install-bundle`, `submit-proposal`), plus
   4. Vote on the submitted proposal.

Bundling Contracts and Core Eval Scripts with Rollup Plugins [​](#bundling-contracts-and-core-eval-scripts-with-rollup-plugins)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Core eval scripts are evaluated, not loaded as modules; so any `import` or `export` declarations are syntax errors. In **dapp-agoric-basics**, we use [rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) to support developing a core-eval script and permit as a module:

* `import { E } from '@endo/far'` A bundle strips this declaration during bundling since the core-eval scope includes exports of `@endo/far`.
* `bundleID = ...` is replaced using updated/cached bundle hash
* `main` is appended as the script completion value
* the `permit` export is emitted to a `.json` file

See [rollup.config.mjs](https://github.com/Agoric/dapp-agoric-basics/blob/main/contract/rollup.config.mjs) for details on using the `moduleToScript`, `configureBundleID`, and `emitPermit` rollup plug-ins.

Running it looks something like this:

console
```
dapp-agoric-basics/contract$ yarn build:deployer
yarn run v1.22.19
$ rollup -c rollup.config.mjs

./src/sell-concert-tickets.proposal.js → bundles/deploy-sell-concert-tickets.js...
bundles add: sell-concert-tickets from ./src/sell-concert-tickets.contract.js

...

dapp-agoric-basics/contract$ cd bundles
dapp-agoric-basics/contract/bundles$ ls deploy-sell* bundle-sell*
bundle-sell-concert-tickets.js          deploy-sell-concert-tickets-permit.json deploy-sell-concert-tickets.js
```

Ensuring you have enough IST to install a bundle [​](#ensuring-you-have-enough-ist-to-install-a-bundle)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The price to install a contract is subject to chain governance. As of [proposal #61](https://agoric.explorers.guru/proposal/61) Nov 2023, it's 0.02IST per kilobyte.

On a local chain, `yarn start` includes a `yarn docker:make mint100` step to get 100 IST, which should be enough. *`mint100` works by sending some ATOM from a `validator` account and using the ATOM to open a vault.*

Installing, submitting to agoriclocal with `scripts/deploy-contract.js` [​](#installing-submitting-to-agoriclocal-with-scripts-deploy-contract-js)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In **dapp-agoric-basics**, [contract/scripts/deploy-contract.js](https://github.com/Agoric/dapp-agoric-basics/blob/main/contract/scripts/deploy-contract.js) automates much of the process. `yarn start` automatically runs it. The `--install src/sell-concert-tickets.contract.js` option tells it to install the contract (using [agd tx swingset install-bundle](/guides/agoric-cli/agd-query-tx.html#agd-tx-swingset-install-bundle) from within the docker container), after bundling it if necessary:

```
dapp-agoric-basics/contract$ yarn start
yarn run v1.22.19
$ yarn docker:make clean start-contract print-key
$ docker compose exec agd make -C /workspace/contract clean start-contract print-key
make: Entering directory '/workspace/contract'
yarn node ./scripts/deploy-contract.js --service . \
        --install src/sell-concert-tickets.contract.js \
        --eval ./src/sell-concert-tickets.proposal.js
yarn node v1.22.21
bundles add: sell-concert-tickets from src/sell-concert-tickets.contract.js

}

{
  name: 'sell-concert-tickets',
  id: 'b1-8dd96',
  installHeight: '1594',
  installed: true
}
...
```

As a by-product, it writes a `bundles/bundle-sell-concert-tickets.json.installed` file. If you run `yarn start` again, `deploy-contract.js` uses the `Makefile` to check whether the `.installed` file is up-to-date and only repeats `agd tx swingset install-bundle` if you change the contract.

The `--eval ./src/sell-concert-tickets.proposal.js` option tells it to submit a `swingset-core-eval` governance proposal, after building the script and permit if necessary:

console
```
...
submit proposal sell-concert-tickets
[
  'bundles/deploy-sell-concert-tickets-permit.json',
  'bundles/deploy-sell-concert-tickets.js'
]
await tx [
  'bundles/deploy-sell-concert-tickets-permit.json',

]

The `deploy-contract.js` automates adding a deposit and voting on the proposal and waiting for voting to complete:

```
...

  voting_end_time: '2024-03-09T16:50:36.973940196Z'
}
```

When the proposal passes, `deploy-contract.js` writes a `deploy-sell-concert-tickets.js.done` file to avoid running it again unnecessarily.

Troubleshooting Local Core Eval Proposals

Use `yarn docker:logs` to check for any errors in the execution of the core eval script.

Deploying to testnets (devnet, emerynet, ...) [​](#deploying-to-testnets-devnet-emerynet)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For testnet access and governance norms, see [Guide to Agoric Testnets - Agoric Community Forum](https://community.agoric.com/t/guide-to-agoric-testnets/515). In particular:

* Community developers who are interested to move beyond testing in a local chain are welcome to try their apps on **devnet**. <https://devnet.agoric.net/> provides details such as curreint chain-id, RPC endpoints, software version, explorer, and faucet.
* Feel free to join us at [office hours](https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk/wiki/Office-Hours), whether you're just getting started or you're struggling with a detailed issue.
* Let the community know what you propose to deploy by posting to [community.agoric.com](https://community.agoric.com/).
* Choose appropriate and distinct names for any entries in the [agoricNames](./../integration/name-services.html#agoricnames-agoricnamesadmin-well-known-names) name service.
* Chat with peers on [Agoric Discord](https://agoric.com/discord). See [#get-roles](https://discord.com/channels/585576150827532298/966411985833050164) to add roles for access to channels such as `#dev` and `#devnet`.
* For troubleshooting, access to network node logs is important. Contact a [devnet validator](https://devnet.explorer.agoric.net/agoric/uptime) or [operate your own follower node](https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk/wiki/Validator-Guide-for-Devnet).
* `emerynet` is primarily used for the qualification of production-ready software before it is promoted to mainnet.

In [Getting Started](/guides/getting-started/), we [set up a keplr wallet demo account](/guides/getting-started/#setting-up-a-keplr-wallet-demo-account) with a previously generated key and address for use on the `agoriclocal` chain. You should have your own account and address for **devnet** and other chains. Generate a key and address with [Keplr](https://www.keplr.app/) or [other wallets](https://agoric.com/ecosystem/category/wallets) or with [agd keys add](./../agoric-cli/agd-query-tx.html#agd-keys-add).

With the [devnet faucet](https://devnet.faucet.agoric.net/), you can

* get BLD to stake and vote on your proposal
* get IST to pay for contract storage and execution.

### Installing, submitting with **cosgov** Web UI [​](#installing-submitting-with-cosgov-web-ui)

The Cosmos Proposal Builder at [cosgov.org](https://cosgov.org) is a convenient way to submit the transactions. It supports deploying to the local chain as well as **devnet** etc.

You'll need a `.json` formatted contract bundle:

console
```
dapp-agoric-basics/contract$ yarn bundle-source --cache-json bundles/ src/sell-concert-tickets.contract.js sell-concert-tickets
bundles/ add: sell-concert-tickets from src/sell-concert-tickets.contract.js
bundles/ bundled 141 files in bundle-sell-concert-tickets.json at 2024-03-09T20:48:43.784Z
```
![Install Bundle screenshot](/assets/cosgov-install-bundle.D726zEh2.png)

Then drop your permit and core eval script on the **CoreEval Proposal** tab:

![Install Bundle screenshot](/assets/cosgov-core-eval.DHcTJPM6.png)

Note the required deposit and voting period.

Voting on Core Eval Proposals [​](#voting-on-core-eval-proposals)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

As usual with cosmos governance, stakers vote on proposals. A deposit is required to start the voting period. The deposit is returned unless the proposal is vetoed. Governance parameters such as the minimum deposit and voting period are subject to chain governance. Use an explorer or `agd query gov params` to find the current value. Typical values are:

| chain | voting time | deposit (min) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `agoriclocal` | 10 sec | 1 BLD |
| **devnet** | 5 min | 1 BLD |
| **emerynet** | 2 hrs | 1 BLD |
| **mainnet** | 3 days | 5000 BLD |

On **devnet**, it's best to get others to vote on your proposal as well, though if your community post is well received, it's reasonable to stake enough BLD to unilaterally pass your proposal.

To vote on a proposal in devnet, find it among [Governance Proposals](https://devnet.explorer.agoric.net/agoric/gov) in the devnet explorer and use Keplr to vote. Or use [agd tx gov vote](./../agoric-cli/agd-query-tx.html#agd-tx-gov-vote).

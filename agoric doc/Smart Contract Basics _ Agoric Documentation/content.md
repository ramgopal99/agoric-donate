Smart Contract Basics [​](#smart-contract-basics)
=================================================

This guide is designed to help developers understand how to write smart contracts efficiently and securely. Here, you will find detailed examples that demonstrate different functionalities and use-cases within the context of smart contracts starting from the very basics. To follow along, verify your work, or to get help if you get stuck, you can use the <https://github.com/Agoric/dapp-offer-up/> repo as a reference. Each section of the tutorial has an associated branch in the repo to act as a checkpoint.

Examples [​](#examples)
-----------------------

We provide three core examples to illustrate how to implement various smart contract functionalities:

### 1. Hello World Contract [​](#_1-hello-world-contract)

The **Hello World Contract** demonstrates how to create a simple contract that greets the caller. This example is perfect for understanding the basic structure and syntax of smart contracts. The relevant code is available in [`tut-01-hello` branch](https://github.com/Agoric/dapp-offer-up/tree/tut-01-hello).

### 2. State Contract [​](#_2-state-contract)

The **State Contract** shows how to maintain a state or a variable within a smart contract. This is useful for contracts that need to store data or state across transactions. The relevant code is available in [`tut-02-state` branch](https://github.com/Agoric/dapp-offer-up/tree/tut-02-state).

### 3. Access-Control Contract [​](#_3-access-control-contract)

The **Access-Control Contract** provides an example of how to implement access control, ensuring that only authorized users can call certain functions within the smart contract. The relevant code is available in [`tut-03-access` branch](https://github.com/Agoric/dapp-offer-up/tree/tut-03-access).

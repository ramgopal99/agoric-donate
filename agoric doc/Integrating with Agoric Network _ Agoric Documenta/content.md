Integrating with Agoric Network [​](#integrating-with-agoric-network)
=====================================================================

The Agoric network builds a blockchain for smart contracts in JavaScript using the `cosmos-sdk`. Cosmos-sdk is software that provides the widely-used Tendermint/CometBFT consensus and best-in-class support for chain operations like staking and governance. For simplicity of chain integration, the Agoric Network works identically to the Cosmos Hub, except using different parameters (e.g., `ubld` instead of `uatom`).

TL;DR for Cosmos-experienced [​](#tl-dr-for-cosmos-experienced)
---------------------------------------------------------------

This section points at relevant reference documentation for the underlying `cosmos-sdk` and CometBFT/Tendermint consensus engine, and summarizes the differences.

The Agoric Network currently uses `cosmos-sdk` v0.45. The general Cosmos documentation for this version can be [found here](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.45/), including structure and`golang` documentation, and REST API documentation.

Use the [v0.45.1 version of the REST API](https://v1.cosmos.network/rpc/v0.45.1) for accessing the chain. To use the "Try it out" functionality, change the Base URL to `agoric-api.polkachu.com`:

The chain can also be accessed via JavaScript using the [`cosmjs` library](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs) (and [associated tutorials](https://tutorials.cosmos.network/tutorials/7-cosmjs/1-cosmjs-intro.html)), or using [CosmosKit](https://cosmoskit.com/).

Chain resources [​](#chain-resources)
-------------------------------------

* The base network entry points for the Agoric chain are specified in the [network config](https://main.agoric.net/network-config).
* Additional chain information, including tokens and their logos, gas fee information for wallets, additional entry points, and explorers is maintained in the Cosmos [Chain Registry](https://github.com/cosmos/chain-registry/tree/master/agoric).
* The source code for the Agoric Network runtime and contracts is in [the Agoric open source repository](https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk) on GitHub.
* The base unit for staking is `ubld` (corresponding to `uatom` for Cosmos Hub)
* The command utility of the agoric chain is `agd` (corresponding to [`simd` for the Cosmos Hub](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.45/run-node/interact-node.html)).

Building `agd` [​](#building-agd)
---------------------------------

The `agd` command line tool can be built by running the commands as below:

sh
```
git clone -b community-dev https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk
cd agoric-sdk
SKIP_DOWNLOAD=false ./bin/agd build
export PATH=$PWD/bin:$PATH
```

To confirm that `agd` is in your `$PATH`, execute

```
agd version --long
```

Unlike typical cosmos-sdk chains where the daemon is a single executable file, Agoric's use of cosmos-sdk depends on many components of agoric-sdk at runtime. Copying `agd` to `/usr/local/bin` or the like is unlikely to produce a working installation. For more detail, see [#7825](https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk/issues/7825).

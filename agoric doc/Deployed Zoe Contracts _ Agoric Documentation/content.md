Deployed Zoe Contracts [​](#deployed-zoe-contracts)
===================================================

In the [mainnet-1B release of agoric-sdk](https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk/releases/tag/mainnet1B-rc3), the chain is configured to automatically deploy the following Zoe contracts. A [community post on Inter Protocol Vaults Contract Implementations](https://community.agoric.com/t/inter-protocol-vaults-contract-implementations/261) has a high level description.

| Contract | Description |
| --- | --- |
| centralSupply | used to initialize the vbank IST purse balance based on supply reported from the cosmos x/bank module |
| mintHolder | use to hold mints for BLD as well as inter-chain assets such as ATOM, USDC, and USDT |
| committee | represents the Economic Committee that governs Inter Protocol parameters |
| binaryVoteCounter | instantiated once for each question that a committee votes on |
| econCommitteeCharter | controls what questions can be put to the economic committee |
| contractGovernor | each governed contract is started by starting its governor |
| [PSM](./PSM.html) | The Parity Stability Module (PSM) supports efficiently minting and burning Inter Stable Tokens (ISTs) in exchange for approved external stable tokens. |
| vaultFactory | allows users to mint IST backed by collateral such as ATOM; hands off vaults to auctioneer when value of collateral in a vault falls below a governed threshold |
| auctioneer | auctions collateral from liquidated vaults |
| fluxAggregator | a [Price Authority](./../price-authority.html) that aggregates prices from oracle oeprators |
| scaledPriceAuthoriy | provides prices for tradeable assets such as ATOM in terms of idealized "oracle ATOM" prices from oracle operators |
| feeDistributor | collects fees from Inter Protocol contracts and distributes to reserve and/or stakers |
| assetReserve | holds assets in reserve to back IST |
| walletFactory | executes Zoe offers on behalf of users |

This contract implements coin voting. There are two roles: the Secretary, who can determine the question (a string), make voting invitations, and close the election; and the Voters, who can vote YES or NO on the question. The voters can only get the capability to vote by using a voter invitation to make an offer and escrowing assets. The brand of assets is determined on contract instantiation through an issuerKeywordRecord. The creator gets the only Secretary access through the creatorFacet.

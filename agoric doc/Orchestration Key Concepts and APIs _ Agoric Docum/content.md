Orchestration Key Concepts and APIs [​](#orchestration-key-concepts-and-apis)
=============================================================================

This document provides an overview of the fundamental concepts involved in building Orchestration smart contracts, focusing on Orchestrator Interface, Orchestration Accounts, and ChainHub.

Orchestrator Interface [​](#orchestrator-interface)
---------------------------------------------------

The [`Orchestrator`](https://agoric-sdk.pages.dev/interfaces/_agoric_orchestration.Orchestrator) interface provides a set of high-level methods to manage and interact with local and remote chains. Below are the primary methods:

### Access Chain Object [​](#access-chain-object)

* `getChain` retrieves a chain object for the given `chainName` to get access to chain-specific methods. See [getChain](https://agoric-sdk.pages.dev/interfaces/_agoric_orchestration.Orchestrator#getChain).

js
```
const chain = await orchestrator.getChain('chainName');
```
### Brand Utility Functions [​](#brand-utility-functions)

* `getBrandInfo` returns information about a `denom`, including the equivalent local Brand, the chain where the denom is held, and the chain that issues the corresponding asset. See [getBrandInfo](https://agoric-sdk.pages.dev/interfaces/_agoric_orchestration.Orchestrator#getBrandInfo).

js
```
const brandInfo = orchestrator.getBrandInfo('denom');
```

* `asAmount` converts a denom amount to an `Amount` with a brand. See [asAmount](https://agoric-sdk.pages.dev/interfaces/_agoric_orchestration.Orchestrator#asAmount).

js
```
const amount = orchestrator.asAmount({ denom: 'uatom', value: 1000n });
```

Orchestration Account [​](#orchestration-account)
-------------------------------------------------

Orchestration accounts are a key concept in the Agoric Orchestration API, represented by the [`OrchestrationAccountI`](https://agoric-sdk.pages.dev/interfaces/_agoric_orchestration.OrchestrationAccountI) interface. These accounts provide high-level operations for managing accounts on remote chains, allowing seamless interaction and management of interchain accounts. The Orchestration accounts abstract the complexity of interchain interactions, providing a unified and simplified interface for developers.

### Account Creation [​](#account-creation)

* `makeAccount` (for a chain object) creates a new account on local and/or remote chain as below.

js
```
const [agoric, remoteChain] = await Promise.all([
  orch.getChain('agoric'),
  orch.getChain(chainName)
]);
const [localAccount, remoteAccount] = await Promise.all([
  agoric.makeAccount(),
  remoteChain.makeAccount()
]);
```
### Address Management [​](#address-management)

* `getAddress` retrieves the address of the account on the remote chain.

js
```
const address = await orchestrationAccount.getAddress();
```
### Balance Management [​](#balance-management)

* `getBalances` returns an array of amounts for every balance in the account.
* `getBalance` retrieves the balance of a specific denom for the account.

js
```
const balances = await orchestrationAccount.getBalances();
const balance = await orchestrationAccount.getBalance('uatom');
```
### Funds Transfer [​](#funds-transfer)

* `send` transfers an amount to another account on the same chain.
* `transfer` transfers an amount to another account, typically on another chain.
* `transferSteps` transfers an amount in multiple steps, handling complex transfer paths.
* `deposit` deposits payment from Zoe to the account. For remote accounts, an IBC Transfer will be executed to transfer funds there.

js
```
await orchestrationAccount.send(receiverAddress, amount);
await orchestrationAccount.transfer(amount, destinationAddress);
await orchestrationAccount.transferSteps(amount, transferMsg);
await orchestrationAccount.deposit(payment);
```

ChainHub [​](#chainhub)
-----------------------

ChainHub is a centralized registry of chains, connections, and denoms that simplifies accessing and interacting with multiple chains, providing a unified interface for the Orchestration logic to manage cross-chain operations effectively. A chainHub instance can be created using a call to `makeChainHub` that makes a new ChainHub in the zone (or in the heap if no [zone](/glossary/#zone) is provided). The resulting object is an [Exo](/glossary/#exo) singleton. It has no precious state. Its only state is a cache of queries to `agoricNames` and the info provided in registration calls. When you need a newer version you can simply make a hub and repeat the registrations. ChainHub allows dynamic registration and use of chain and connection information using the following APIs:

### Registration APIs [​](#registration-apis)

* `registerChain` register a new chain with `chainHub`. The name will override a name in well-known chain names.
* `registerConnection` registers a connections between two given chain IDs.
* `registerAsset` registers an asset that may be held on a chain other than the issuing chain. Both corresponding chains should already be registered before this call.

### Information Retrieval [​](#information-retrieval)

* `getChainInfo` takes a chain name to get chain info.
* `getConnectionInfo` returns `Vow<IBCConnectionInfo>` for two given chain IDs.
* `getChainsAndConnection` is used to get chain and connection info given primary and counter chain names.
* `getAsset` retrieves holding, issuing chain names etc. for a denom.
* `getDenom` retrieves denom (string) for a `Brand`.

In the below example, `chainHub` is used to register a new chain and establish a connection between the Agoric chain and the newly registered chain.

js
```
const chainHub = makeChainHub(privateArgs.agoricNames, vowTools);

// Register a new chain with its information
chainHub.registerChain(chainKey, chainInfo);

// Register a connection between the Agoric chain and the new chain
chainHub.registerConnection(
  agoricChainInfo.chainId,
  chainInfo.chainId,
  connectionInfo
);
```

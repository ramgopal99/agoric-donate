Purse Object [​](#purse-object)
===============================

**Purses** hold digital assets. They are created to hold assets of a single **[Brand](./brand.html)**, and the **Brand** that the **Purse** holds cannot be changed. For example, if you were to create a **Purse** that holds *Quatloos*, that **Purse** wouldn't ever be able to hold *Moola*, theater tickets, or any other non-*Quatloo* asset type.

Digital assets in **Purses** can be any of:

* Currency-like, such as our imaginary *Quatloos* currency.
* Goods-like digital assets, such as theater tickets or magic weapons used in a game.
* Other kinds of rights, such as the right to participate in a particular contract.

While each **Purse** can only hold assets of one **Brand**, any number of **Purses** can be created that hold that **Brand**. So you could have, say, three *Quatloos* **Purses**, your friend Alice could have eight *Quatloos* **Purses**, and so on.

**Purses** are created by calling the **[anIssuer.makeEmptyPurse()](./issuer.html#anissuer-makeemptypurse)** method on the **[Issuer](./issuer.html)** associated with the **Brand** of assets you want the new **Purse** to hold.

js
```
const { issuer: quatloosIssuer } = makeIssuerKit('quatloos');
const quatloosPurse = quatloosIssuer.makeEmptyPurse();
```

You change a **Purse**'s balance by calling either **[aPurse.deposit()](#apurse-deposit-payment-optamount)** or **[aPurse.withdraw()](#apurse-withdraw-amount)** on it. A **Purse** can be empty, which if it holds a fungible currency means it has a value of 0. If it holds a non-fungible asset (e.g., theater tickets), then the **Purse** simply doesn't contain any assets if it's empty.

Unlike **[Payments](./payment.html)**, **Purses** are not meant to be sent to others. To transfer digital assets, you should withdraw a **Payment** from a **Purse** and send the **Payment** to another party.

aPurse.getCurrentAmount() [​](#apurse-getcurrentamount)
-------------------------------------------------------

* Returns: **[Amount](./ertp-data-types.html#amount)**

Returns the **Purse**'s current balance as an **Amount**. The returned **Amount** **[AmountValue](./ertp-data-types.html#amountvalue)** might be empty, and might be different the next time you call **aPurse.getCurrentAmount()** on the same **Purse** if assets have been deposited or withdrawn in the interim.

js
```
const { issuer: quatloosIssuer } = makeIssuerKit('quatloos');
const quatloosPurse = quatloosIssuer.makeEmptyPurse();
// quatloos5 is a payment with balance of 5 quatloos
const quatloosPurse.deposit(quatloos5);
// Returns an amount with value = 5 and brand = quatloos
const currentBalance = quatloosPurse.getCurrentAmount();
```

aPurse.getCurrentAmountNotifier() [​](#apurse-getcurrentamountnotifier)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

* Returns: **Notifier<[Amount](./ertp-data-types.html#amount)>**

Returns a lossy notifier for changes to this **Purse**'s balance. For more details, see [Notifiers](/guides/js-programming/notifiers.html).

js
```
const notifier = purse.getCurrentAmountNotifier();
let nextUpdate = notifier.getUpdateSince();

const checkNotifier = async () => {
  const { value: balance, updateCount } = await nextUpdate;
  nextUpdate = notifier.getUpdateSince(updateCount);
};
```

aPurse.deposit(payment, optAmount?) [​](#apurse-deposit-payment-optamount)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

* **payment**: **[Payment](./payment.html)**
* **optAmount**: **[Amount](./ertp-data-types.html#amount)** - Optional.
* Returns: **Amount**

Deposit all the contents of *payment* into the **Purse**, returning an **Amount** describing the **Payment**'s digital assets (i.e. the deposited amount). If the optional argument *optAmount* does not equal the balance of *payment*, or if *payment* is a promise, this method throws an error.

While the above applies to local and remote **Purses**, for remote **Purses** there may be effects on this operation due to the use of promises and asynchronicity. You have to have a non-promise **Payment** before calling **aPurse.deposit()**. When you call **aPurse.deposit()** you get a response back (after waiting for the round trip) telling you if it succeeded. All later arriving calls see the value has been transferred into the **Purse**, and the **Payment** is no longer valid.

If any withdrawals are waiting for promises to resolve, a deposit operation may pass them by. This is safe, as even if all the assets are withdrawn, the deposit still works on an empty **Purse**.

js
```
const {
  issuer: quatloosIssuer,
  mint: quatloosMint,
  brand: quatloosBrand
} = makeIssuerKit('quatloos');
const quatloosPurse = quatloosIssuer.makeEmptyPurse();
const payment = quatloosMint.mintPayment(AmountMath.make(quatloosBrand, 123n));
const quatloos123 = AmountMath.make(quatloosBrand, 123n);

// Deposit a payment for 123 Quatloos into the Purse.
const depositAmountA = quatloosPurse.deposit(payment, quatloos123);

const secondPayment = quatloosMint.mintPayment(
  AmountMath.make(quatloosBrand, 100n)
);
// Throws error
const depositAmountB = quatloosPurse.deposit(secondPayment, quatloos123);
```

aPurse.withdraw(amount) [​](#apurse-withdraw-amount)
----------------------------------------------------

* **amount**: **[Amount](./ertp-data-types.html#amount)**
* Returns: **[Payment](./payment.html)**

Withdraws the specified **Amount** of digital assets from the **Purse** into a new **Payment** object.

If the call succeeds, it immediately extracts the value into a new **Payment**. The caller won't get the new **Payment** until a later turn, since the call is (nearly always) remote. But as soon as the message is processed, the value is gone from the **Purse**.

js
```
// Create a Purse and give it a balance of 10 Quatloos
const { issuer, mint, brand } = makeIssuerKit('quatloos');
const purse = issuer.makeEmptyPurse();
const payment = mint.mintPayment(AmountMath.make(brand, 10n));
const quatloos10 = AmountMath.make(brand, 10n);
purse.deposit(payment, quatloos10);

// Withdraw an amount of 3 from the Purse
const quatloos3 = AmountMath.make(brand, 3n);
const withdrawalPayment = purse.withdraw(quatloos3);

// The balance of the withdrawal payment is 3 Quatloos
issuer.getAmountOf(withdrawalPayment);

// The new balance of the Purse is 7 Quatloos
purse.getCurrentAmount();
```

aPurse.getAllegedBrand() [​](#apurse-getallegedbrand)
-----------------------------------------------------

* Returns: **[Brand](./brand.html)**

Returns an alleged brand (Note: a **Brand**, not a **String** as **allegedName()** methods do), indicating what kind of digital asset the **Purse** purports to hold. This can identify the **Purse**'s **Brand** if the **Purse** was made by a trusted **[Issuer](./issuer.html)** using **[anIssuer.makeEmptyPurse()](./issuer.html#anissuer-makeemptypurse)**.

js
```
const purseBrand = quatloosPurse.getAllegedBrand();
```

aPurse.getDepositFacet() [​](#apurse-getdepositfacet)
-----------------------------------------------------

* Returns: **DepositFacet**

Creates and returns a **DepositFacet**, a new deposit-only facet of the **Purse** that allows other parties to deposit **[Payments](./payment.html)** into the **Purse** without the ability to check the **Purse's** balance or withdraw from it. This makes it a safe way to let other people send you **Payments**.

You can only deposit a **Payment** into a **DepositFacet** that's the same **[Brand](./brand.html)** as the original **Purse**.

js
```
const depositOnlyFacet = purse.getDepositFacet();

// Give depositOnlyFacet to someone else. Anyone with a deposit facet reference can tell it to receive
// a payment, thus depositing the payment assets in the Purse associated with the deposit facet.
depositOnlyFacet.receive(payment);
```

Once you have created a **DepositFacet**, there is one method you can call on it, **[aDepositFacet.receive()](#adepositfacet-receive-payment-optamount)**. The **DepositFacet** takes a **Payment** and adds it to the balance of the **DepositFacet**'s associated **Purse**. The **Payment** must be of the same **Brand** as what the **Purse** holds.

Note the difference in method names for adding assets between a **Purse** and its **DepositFacet**. To add assets to a **Purse** directly, you use **aPurse.deposit()**. To add assets to a **Purse** via its **DepositFacet**, you use **aDepositFacet.receive()**.

aDepositFacet.receive(payment, optAmount?) [​](#adepositfacet-receive-payment-optamount)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* **payment**: **[Payment](./payment.html)**
* **optAmount**: **[Amount](./ertp-data-types.html#amount)** - Optional.
* Returns **Amount**

The **DepositFacet** takes the **Payment** and adds it to the balance of the **DepositFacet**'s associated **Purse**.

If the optional argument *optAmount* does not equal the balance of *payment*, or if *payment* is an unresolved promise, this method throws an error.

js
```
const depositOnlyFacet = purse.getDepositFacet();

// Give depositOnlyFacet to someone else. Anyone with a deposit facet reference can tell it to receive
// a payment, thus depositing the payment assets in the Purse associated with the deposit facet.
depositOnlyFacet.receive(payment);
```
